Single responsibility principle
in this case we started with a bunch of service logic happening in our controller
- controllers should be handling requests only, adding more means that it has more than one responsibility
- at the beginning it is validating users and then saving them to the store
- going to port the logic from the controller to the service and validation areas
- controller should be recieving requests, handing the request to the rest of the app and returning the result


Once we move them around the Validator is only validating and is isolated nicely
Same with persitstence service, it handles the saving of users
